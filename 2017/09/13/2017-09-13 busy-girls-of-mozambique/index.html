<p>In a dusty courtyard of Mozambique’s Chirangano neighbourhood, Deborah, 18, clicks away at her mobile phone. Earlier in the day, she had been discussing family planning with the girls in her community and they had stumbled upon a question they didn’t know the answer to. Deborah types it in a text message, <em>“Is it true that ART cures people with AIDS?”</em> and presses “Send”. </p>
<p><em>Ping.</em> 1,500 km north in Maputo, Deborah’s question pops up on the computer screen of Ana, 21, a peer counsellor. She is one of 12 counsellors in the crowded room responding to questions sent in by youths through SMS from all over the country. After consulting a dense FAQ manual in the background, Ana proceeds to reply to Deborah, <em>“Hello friend, antiretroviral therapy, or ART, does not cure AIDS but strengthens the immune system which can prevent virus growth”.</em></p>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been steady progress towards gender equality in Mozambique, one of the most rapidly developing countries in Africa. In August 2016, the government together with UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women and Coalizao launched the Action for Girls programme dubbed Rapariga Biz, aimed at reaching 1 million vulnerable adolescent girls by training girls through weekly “sessions” to act as mentors in their local communities on topics ranging from sexual and reproductive health, to menstrual hygiene management. Despite improvements, girls and young women still face stark gender inequities, including early marriage and pregnancy, lack of access to education, and gender-based violence in Mozambique. The problem lies in how to engage, educate, and empower these girls so they have access to the rights and opportunities they deserve. </p>
<p><strong>A potential solution is technology.</strong> Mozambique is one of the most rapidly developing countries in Africa, and access to ICT including mobile phones has been increasing steadily. Bright posters advertising cell providers like Movitel and Vodacom litter Deborah’s neighbourhood, and as of 2012, a survey by the World Bank showed that 42.5% of the national population owned a mobile phone.[2] SMS BIZ, also known as U-Report, is UNICEF’s free digital youth engagement tool used by over 100,000 U-Reporters nationally, 40% of them who are girls. Traditionally, the platform has been used by UNICEF Country Offices as a way to hear from youths directly, through regular polling and surveys. But as part of UNICEF’s Innovation Gender Challenge, the organization’s commitment to find innovative solutions supporting gender programming in countries, SMS BIZ is being used in a novel, ingenious way - as a peer counsel service, equipping more than 1,000 Rapariga Biz girl mentors with mobile phones and knowledge to their most pressing questions and concerns. When speaking to Deborah, she wears her mentor lanyard and grips onto her mobile phone with pride. “I use SMS BIZ when I, or a girl I mentor, want more information that hasn’t been covered in a mentor training session. I feel safe and comfortable asking my questions because it’s anonymous,” she explains. Texts that Deborah and other girls send in are answered by Coalizão, a youth association of 48 volunteer peer counsellors in Maputo, including Ana, who work tirelessly around the clock to respond with accuracy and speed to nearly a thousand questions a day. On her motivation of becoming a peer counsellor, Ana explains, “I want to provide correct information through SMS BIZ to other young girls like me because we often feel uncomfortable asking our parents about these issues”. </p>

<p>As part of the Challenge, SMS BIZ has also been testing other innovative methods to engage and recruit more girls on to the platform. Just this week, pilots have begun for a new girl-to-girl invitation system where girl users will be able to send referrals to their friends over mobile, encouraging other girls to join SMS BIZ and be a part of the important conversation. SMS BIZ is also supporting girl mentors by testing their knowledge on previous session topics through biweekly SMS polls, dubbed “the Game of Questions and Answers”, with the goal of reinforcing learning and identifying knowledge gaps to focus on in future training sessions. </p>
<p>There are countless challenges and barriers the millions of girls in Mozambique face from realizing their goals and a healthier, more prosperous future, and innovations like SMS BIZ can help. For Deborah, she is applying to scholarships in hopes of attending university in the near future and becoming a scientist. When asked what could possibly help her reach her dreams, she looks down at the mobile phone that hasn’t left her hands all evening. She fiddles with the keypad for a moment before landing upon an answer. </p>
