            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                <p>This Memorial Day weekend, I was walking through the shopping mall with my girlfriend, Elisa, taking advantage of the holiday deals, when a sales associate at the sunglass kiosk we were passing by shouted at us, “ni hao!” Her anglicized pronounciation of the Mandarin greeting for “hello” drew out of me an exasperated but polite, “That comes off as a little racist,” as Elisa and I continued on our way. Throughout my life, I’ve had “ni hao” thrown at me by countless strangers who clearly do not speak Mandarin. They take one look at my physical features and presume that I must be Chinese, and I must speak Mandarin. They are incorrect. </p>
<p> <img src="/img/2017-05-29 baby-betty.jpg" alt="Baby Betty"><br><em>Me, as a tot, graduating from Montessori preschool in North York, Canada</em></p>
<p>I grew up a proud Canadian in the suburbs of Toronto, born to Chinese parents who emphasized multiculturalism and opportunity as the biggest reasons of immigrating to Canada. I’ve lived my entire life in the Western hemisphere, in big cities like San Francisco, Geneva, and now New York. Yes, I have an interest in the Chinese economy and history, dim sum is my favourite brunch meal, and my physical features are that of an East Asian; but I can barely string together a sentence in Mandarin and my prefered language of communication is English. This is one of the reasons why the regular, unsolicited “ni hao”s that are hollered at me by strangers irritate and bewilder me. </p>
<p>The other reason is that these strangers who don’t know me, yet who still insist on greeting me in Mandarin, symbolize a disturbing ignorance of racial understanding that is prevalent and, today, more dangerous than ever. Physical features are taken at face-value to match the stereotypes, and dictate the way that people should act towards one another. A woman who works at Google is assumed to be in HR and never the software engineer. A Jewish businessman is viewed by a new client as greedy and dishonest. A hijab-wearing Muslim is flagged as a terror threat by airport security. These stereotypes are much worse than my East Asian facial features warranting a “ni hao” instead of a “hello”. But in this political climate where borders are being resurrected both figuratively between ethnicities, religions, genders, and social classes, and literally between countries, complicitness is the most dangerous reaction. The best weapon to combat the prevailing prejudice and discrimination is to speak out.</p>
<p><strong>And so I’m speaking out.</strong></p>
<p>Later, that Memorial Day, I reflected to Elisa how verbalizing my disapproving opinion to the sale associate left me with a surprising sense of content. Previous encounters of “ni hao” were met with me brushing it off, walking a little faster past strangers, and when in the comfort of my own home, complaining privately to close friends. This was the first time where I hadn’t internalized my opinion, and spoke my mind to a stranger on the matter.</p>
<p>Logically, I always rationalized with one of the following points that there’s no point of speaking up: (a) it’s not a battle worth fighting, especially with a stranger; (b) most people don’t have an intent to harm; and/or (c) frankly, speaking out can be dangerous. Additionally, I’ve always been hyper-aware about how I articulate myself - cautious, careful, passive, and politically neutral as to avoid confrontation. “Like Switzerland”, I used to boast on my diplomatic temperament and role as an observer rather than a player in heated debates. But I - like most - expect change in the world, from climate change mitigation to healthcare reform. I have big dreams and bigger expectations of a better future, but it’s not fair for me to put the burden on others to be actors of the change I want. Dialogue catalyzes change, and so I need to facilitate and be part of the dialogue. </p>
<p>One of my personal heroes, Malala Yousafzai, a fearless champion for girls’ education, wrote the autobiography I Am Malala. At one point in her story, she ruminated on what she would do if ever faced with the Taliban soldiers who were attempting to hunt her down and silence her activism:</p>
<p><cite>“Maybe I’d take off my shoes and hit him, but then I’d think if I did that there would be no difference between me and a terrorist. It would be better to plead, ‘OK, shoot me, but first listen to me. What you are doing is wrong. I’m not against you personally, I just want every girl to go to school.”</cite> </p>
<p><strong>It’s as important to listen as it is to speak.</strong> </p>
<p>Free speech is the cornerstone of our society, and with bipartisan tensions rising across the globe between the left and right, many people have interpreted freedom of speech incorrectly as grounds to accuse, jump to conclusions, and act on summary judgment. More than ever, people are taking aim to shoot before listening. This year alone, there has been an onset of this toxic propensity to silence anyone with differing views on college campuses. At UC Berkeley, violent student protests and riots broke out against right-wing controversialists, Ann Coulter and Milo Yiannopoulos, that forced them to cancel their appearances amidst security concerns. At Evergreen State College this week, a white biology professor was subject to a rogue student inquisition where dozens of students cornered and harassed him about racism, white privilege, and even white supremacy without letting him speak. Academic institutions should be safe havens for discussions, and sharing of views; but these days, contesting ideas have the exact opposite effect, which means a loss of progress. </p>
<p>On being greeted “ni hao”, Elisa, who also happens to look East Asian, brought up a different point of view from mine. “The sales associate probably encounters many Mandarin-speaking customers in the mall who don’t speak English, and so is trying to build rapport in their language to sell them sunglasses. Also, how can you assume she doesn’t know Mandarin?” Elisa countered. Elisa was right that the mall we were at was a hotspot for tourists. Even though we were smack dab in English-speaking New York, what if I was the outlier, and that most people who looked like me at the mall spoke Mandarin as their first language? Was I being too sensitive? At that moment, I realized that although I had no regrets in sharing with the sales associate my opinion, I didn’t stop to listen to her side of the story and what she had to say. </p>
<p>This is a call to all that we need to speak up, but we also need to listen. We should be having dialogue, debate, and discussion with friends, family, coworkers, and even strangers, because all our voices matter in having the critical conversations that shape progress and a prosperous, progressive future. </p>
<p><strong>Let’s have a conversation.</strong>  </p>
