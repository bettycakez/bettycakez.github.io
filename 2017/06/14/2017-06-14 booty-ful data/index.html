                <p>One of my sacred routine rituals is my morning runs through Central Park, made possible by a kickass Spotify soundtrack. But as I was jogging down the home stretch of the Reservoir this morning, feeling the groove of the playlist I was listening to, I paid some attention to the lyrics. </p>
<p><cite>“Ass ass ass ass ass…”</cite></p>
<p>For the rest of my run, my ears perked up to the words and lyrics beyond the quick tempos and heavy beats that I usually focus on. My blood was pumping for a very different reason as I zoned in on lyrics like “She a bad bitch, make it bounce bitch” and “How the hell you get all that ass in them pants?” I was appalled by the number of lyrics that referred to women in a derogatory and overly sexualized way, in these pop hits listened to by young girls and boys no less. </p>
<p>Misogyny in rap and hip-hop culture is nothing new. There are tons of articles such as Michelle Wallace’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/29/arts/pop-view-when-black-feminism-faces-the-music-and-the-music-is-rap.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank" rel="external">piece</a> in the New York Times from 1990 that tackle the issue well, and even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny_in_rap_music" target="_blank" rel="external">Wikipedia page</a> dedicated to the subject matter. But I was morbidly curious as to how I had been listening to this workout playlist, aptly titled “Workout Twerkout” and never noticed the mentions of “asses”, “bitches”, and “booty” both verbatim and implicitly until now. [1] Was the frequency actually as high as I perceived or was this an availability heuristic, a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events due to how unusual or emotionally charge they may be?</p>
<p>I had no idea but I was determined to find out. </p>
<h2 id="Data-is-booty-ful"><a href="#Data-is-booty-ful" class="headerlink" title="Data is booty-ful"></a>Data is booty-ful</h2><p>RapCaviar is the most popular rap/hip-hop playlist on Spotify, curated by Spotify’s Head of Hip Hop programming, with almost 3 million followers globally. The playlist showcases the “best” and most popular current rap/hip-hop hits and as of June 14, 2017 has 51 songs. In figuring out if rap culture is as misogynistic as my morning run revelation had made out, I decided RapCaviar would be the “best” sample of songs to use in answering the following questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>How misogynistic are these hip-hop/rap songs?</li>
<li>Is there a difference in misogyny of rap/hip-hop songs between female and male rappers?</li>
<li>How does misogyny in rap/hip-hop compare to other genres?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Measuring misogyny</strong></p>
<p>To measure how misogynistic a song is, I took the rate at which artist(s) mentioned misogynistic keywords** that reference women in a prejudiced way, whether referring to women in an objectifying, demeaning, or sexualized way, or violence against women. [2]</p>
<p><strong>Most rap songs discuss women in a misogynistic way.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>94% of the songs were labelled as containing explicit content by Spotify. </li>
<li>323 misogynistic keywords were found in the playlist, making up 11% of all song lyrics and averaging 6 keywords per song. </li>
<li>41 or 80% of the RapCaviar songs had some mentioned of women in a derogatory way, and in every one of those songs, women were referred to as “bitch” at least once.</li>
<li>In fact, women were called “bitch” a whopping 227 times in the playlist, which is an average of 4.5 times per song.</li>
<li>The song with the most mentions of misogynistic keywords, which made up 7% of the song, was HUMBLE by Kendrick Lamar ft. Rihanna. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There are fewer female rappers, but they tend to be less demeaning towards women.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Only 7, or less than 14%, of the songs featured female rappers, and only 2 songs or a tiny 4%  were solely by female rappers and not just a feature. Were less likely to </li>
<li>Female rappers only referred to other women using misogynistic keywords once, and that was in SZA’s Supermodel where she raps “got some new hobbies / even a new hoe too”.</li>
<li>But just because a female rapper doesn’t rap herself about misogynistic material, the songs in which she collaborates with male artists still contains a high number of misogynistic keywords. In the 7 songs that female rappers were soloists or collaborated on, there were 56 misogynistic keywords tagged, or 8 keywords per song which is higher than the 6 keywords per song average for the entire playlist including songs featuring only male rappers. </li>
</ul>
<p>Reflecting on the findings from my exercise, I’d like to conclude with some notes: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reliability and accuracy of the data.</strong> Although I chose RapCaviar to be a good sample of general rap culture as it is the most popular rap music at the moment, it may just be this week’s playlist that is especially misogynistic (RapCaviar playlist is updated by Spotify regularly) or maybe there is a causation effect of misogynistic rap songs becoming more popular with listeners. Larger sample sizes would lead to more accurate findings. Lastly, the misogynistic keywords that were measured are the most common terms used, and other misogynistic words that were less common, elusive, or just plain slang that I didn’t understand i.e. “titties”, were not counted in keywords even if they were misogynistic - therefore this estimate should be considered conservative. </li>
<li>Although looking specifically at misogyny, songs that weren’t misogynistic were also inappropriate to other demographics besides women. Take All Around the World by Mura Masa ft. Desiigner didn’t have a mention of women but did tell us to “get retarded”, a slight to people living with retardation. </li>
<li>As a woman who would never want to be spoken to as in these rap songs, I’ve made a conscious effort to switch over and support some more thoughtful, uplifting, empowering rap tracks during my runs, amongst my current favourites is Swet Shop Boys. </li>
</ul>
<p>[1] A whopping 23% of songs had explicit references to butts in the title of the “Workout Twerkout” playlist (as of June 14, 2017).<br>[2] Misogynistic keywords were “ass”, “butt”, “hoe”, “bitch”, “pussy”, “sex”, “tit”.</p>
