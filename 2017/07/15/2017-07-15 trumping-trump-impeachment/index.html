                <p>Last week, California Democrat Rep. Rob Sherman filed the first “formal” article of impeachment against President Donald Trump on grounds of obstruction of justice into ex-FBI Director Comey’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Constant murmurs of impeachment have circulated around communities, the press, and policymakers, ever since Trump was elected into office on November 8, 2016, and they grow louder after every stupidly bizzare action him, his administration, and his family takes, like Trump’s firing of Comey or Donald Trump Jr. seeking out negative information from a Russian official on Hillary Clinton. But what are the actual chances of impeachment? According to historical data of past Presidents, very slim. </p>
<p><img src="/img/2017-07-15 trumping-trump-presidents.png" alt="Time in office of US Presidents"></p>
<p>Trump has been in office for 173 days now. That’s already longer than William Harrison, the 9th president of the US who died of pneumonia 31 days into his term, and more than one-tenth into Trump’s full four-year term. Out of the 44 presidents of the United States since Washington in 1797, 33 who were elected into office served at least one full term; four were assassinated while in office; three died of other causes; one resigned; and none have ever been impeached.</p>
<p>Yes, Trump is on track to becoming the worst president in the history of the US. But the data clearly reflects that presidents who implemented terrible policies, said terrible things, and were wholly terrible people still serve full terms. In the recent few decades, George W. Bush made the case for invading Iraq via unsubstantiated claims that their leader possessed weapons of mass destruction and in the process racking up $1 trillion in US debt. Bill Clinton took his moral shortcomings to the White House which led to impeachment on grounds of perjury to a grand jury and obstruction of justice before ultimately being acquitted by the Senate. Additionally, the burden of proof for impeachment is extremely high and a lengthy process… although probably not as lengthy as the 2016 election campaign which lasted 597-days. The closest a President has been to being removed from office was Nixon, who resigned before certain impeachment where audiotapes clearly proved the charges of obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress against him during the Watergate scandal. </p>
<p>Whether impeachment is likely or not, headlines since November like <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-a-trump-impeachment-could-mean-for-2020-70506" target="_blank" rel="external">“What a Trump impeachment could mean for 2020”</a> and <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-impeachment-bets-234931" target="_blank" rel="external">“Trump impeached? You can bet on it”</a> reflect the rampant fixation on Trump’s impeachment as the solution. “He’ll get impeached soon enough,” I overheard a New York commuter exclaim wistfully to her friend the other day. It is this hopefulness and fixation on impeachment that is dangerous and deconstructive. </p>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, as of now, there is little chance of impeachment beyond what historical data indicates. The article of impeachment introduced by Rep. Sherman has little backing from both sides as Democrats worry that it will further energize Trump’s supporters, and has even slimmer chance of passing in the Republican-led House. <strong>Secondly</strong>, Americans have become so reliant on the idea of impeachment that they’ve taken themselves out of the equation for progress - change starts locally and involves Americans mobilizing: calling our Senators everyday and voicing our concerns; volunteering at our local sexual and reproductive health clinics; reducing our carbon footprint by recycling, carpooling, and eating less red meats; calling out fake news and sharing the stories of immigrants, women, LGBTQ comrades, and refugees who make up America’s melting pot. <strong>Thirdly</strong>, even if Trump is impeached, the battle is won but not the war. Americans were the ones that elected Trump into the White House which points to a scarier problem that starts with getting Americans engaged in politics, and challenging and changing ever-divisive mindsets through conversation. Additionally, Trump on many fronts only exaberated American and global issues that existed long before he entered the White House, like fighting climate change, longstanding racial and religious discrimination, and LGBTQ rights. <strong>Lastly</strong>, if Trump is impeached, we’ll have Pence in office, the current Vice President who believes “smoking doesn’t kill” and “science is very mixed on the subject of global warming”. </p>
<p>So let’s stop talking about impeachment and get to work. Here’s a list of things you can do to take <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/organizations-that-need-your-help-after-the-2016-election?utm_term=.pd3Bk1Gryz#.csBJP2doQD" target="_blank" rel="external">action</a>, and <a href="http://time.com/money/4566160/trump-election-charities-donate/" target="_blank" rel="external">organizations</a> that you can donate to to trump Trump. </p>
