                                    <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                                        <p>In my junior year of high school, I decided to run for Vice-President of my Student Council. I had the qualifying credentials: Reputation and good grades with teachers; and years of service as President of the Announcements team, member of the Waterpolo and Swim Team, and a volunteer at Best Buddies. I campaigned hard: I listened to the biggest challenges and complaints of students in hallways, on social media, and on busses; enlisted trusty friends to spread the word; and had a talented running mate for President. I had a tangible, ambitious platform: more funding for school events and extracurriculars; new diversity programs targeted to freshmen &amp; women; and extended exam periods. And during Speech Day - the pivotal make-or-break moment of the campaign - I summarized all of this in an uplifting speech that I poured nights and mornings into editing and perfecting, while my opponent rapped a verse of the Fresh Prince theme song… </p>
<p>I lost. The days and weeks after, I was devastated. I truly believed that I was the most qualified candidate, I had put so much effort, heart and thought into my campaign, not to mention the embarrassment of losing in front of all my friends, peers and teachers…  </p>
<p>At the time, it felt like the biggest, most painful heartbreak ever (yes, high school Betty was very dramatic). And although it was difficult and bitter to swallow defeat, I realized that wasn’t the first time I’d ever lose nor would it be the last. 2017 was a year of taking chances and major successes. I started writing and publishing in major publications, I traveled to Africa for the first time to work on a dream project, and trained to become an Activist Council member for Planned Parenthood NYC. And throughout it all, I lost. Alot. I was passed over for a potential new job that I completed four rounds of interviews for, I applied to one of the biggest intergovernmental conferences in the world and was rejected, and I rallied and protested against a Republican Tax Rewrite that ultimately was passed. </p>
<p>Here’s what I learned in 2017:</p>
<p><img src="/img/2018-01-01 new-year-2018.jpg" alt="New Year 2018"><br><em>Above: In Mozambique with UNICEF implementing a sexual and reproductive health peer counsel service. Definitive highlight of 2018!</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Be ambitious</strong><br>Ambition is sometimes taken as a word with negative connotations of greed, reductiveness and selfishness. But for me, ambition is about the impact I can make on the world, breaking glass ceilings that stand in the way.</p>
<p><strong>2. Learn from your losses</strong><br>I learn more from losing than from winning anyways. Every loss can be attributed to factors within and beyond your control, so dissect what you did have control of, what you can do better next time, and move on - apply these learnings to the future endeavours you take on. </p>
<p><strong>3. Just do it</strong><br>Nike said it best. Don’t just talk the talk, but turn words, ambition, and big dreams into action with tangible goals and results. </p>
<p>And as we move into a New Year, take this ambition, learnings, and action to bring the change you want to see in the world to life. Best wishes, and looking forward to seeing what 2018 holds for you and me!</p>
<p>On a side tangent: One of my New Year “goals” was to read a book a week, at the least. Coincidentally, the first book I just finished was <em>What Happened</em> by HRC, a lady I admire greatly for breaking glass ceilings consistently over the past few decades, paving the way for women and girls to dream big. Her recountings of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election also happened to trigger the memory of my much less consequential High School Student Council Vice-Presidential defeat… </p>
