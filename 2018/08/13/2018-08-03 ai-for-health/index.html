                                        <p>As first published in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-computers-global-healthcare-malaria-facebook-a8327901.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Independent</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2018-08-03-health-ai-imagen.jpg" alt="Imagen"><br><em>Imagen, a NY-based startup has built OsteoDetect, a computer-aided detection and diagnosis software designed to detect wrist fractures in adult patients.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the present. Artificial intelligence, computer systems capable of human intelligence, are upending the way we work and play. Investments in AI are dominated by the private sector, where tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Alibaba are joined by a host of research institutions and stealthy startups raised a whopping $15.2 billion last year. AI may still be in its infancy, but progress is moving fast and its applications seem limitless. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the data-rich, health sector. AI has the potential to provide more precise, personalized care, direct our focus from treatment to prevention, and tackle some of the biggest global health issues the world is facing. It’s not only smart for public and social sectors to start investing in AI. It’s essential. </p>
<h1 id="Every-person-counts"><a href="#Every-person-counts" class="headerlink" title="Every person counts"></a>Every person counts</h1><p>Good AI needs good data. Take the dramatic advances in machine learning, a subset of AI, which uses extensive data to learn and improve without explicitly being programmed. Health data ranges from patient records and medical scans, to population data and global health indicators. Coupled with varied measurement standards, collection and storage methods, and regulatory requirements, health data is complex and invaluable. But there’s a data gap. Millions of births and more than 38 million deaths go unreported each year; for registered deaths, 75% fail to include a cause of death. A lack of information on the most vulnerable – minorities, the poor, those living in rural regions and in emergencies – biases systems. It is essential to create the infrastructure to collect, centralize, and construct equitable datasets, ensuring that every country, community, and person counts. </p>
<h1 id="The-ethics-of-AI"><a href="#The-ethics-of-AI" class="headerlink" title="The ethics of AI"></a>The ethics of AI</h1><p>“The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data,” the Economist declared last year when outlining the importance of regulating the Internet giants. If we’ve learned anything from Facebook’s dealings with Cambridge Analytica, conversations on AI governance and fairness are essential to place people’s interests first. We have the opportunity to represent the patients and health professionals we serve, researching implications and risks and designing the policies required to maximize AI for good. How can we ensure that the benefits of AI don’t just accrue to a small number of people by reinforcing bias and discrimination? What is under the black box of how algorithms get from point A to Z, reaching medical decisions that may be the difference between life and death? When handling confidential patient data, how can we guarantee privacy, security, and transparency to gain users’ trust? These ethics questions can only be answered when governments, civil societies, and NGOs take a seat at the table. </p>
<h1 id="It-starts-with-people-not-machines"><a href="#It-starts-with-people-not-machines" class="headerlink" title="It starts with people, not machines"></a>It starts with people, not machines</h1><p>Capacity building and partnerships around this emerging field lets us adapt and innovate. Leaders should prioritize exploring how AI-enabled solutions can catalyze and accelerate strategic health agendas. UN Global Pulse, an initiative to adopt big data, AI, and emerging technologies in development and humanitarian settings, analyzed radio content in Uganda using machine learning to distill patterns on malaria outbreaks, the leading cause of death in the country. The Pulse Labs collaborate with local universities co-hosting seminars to present and share research ideas and tools. Creating an open knowledge network ensures that lessons and training in a new generation of skillsets reach the programme managers, data scientists, and policymakers on the ground. Critically, bridging the technological breakthroughs of the private sector with the social missions of the public sector will bring thoughtful perspectives and diverse talent from all sides. An example is Partnership on AI, which includes prominent tech companies and research institutions alongside a handful of non-profits like UNICEF, Human Rights Watch, and ACLU working “to ensure that applications of AI are beneficial to people and society”.</p>
<p>A sustainable, multi-stakeholder ecosystem, globally and locally, can build the foundational safeguards to maximize the value generated by AI for the whole of society. Imagine. Where non-communicable diseases are now the leading cause of mortality worldwide, computer vision helps detect early signs of Alzheimer’s and melanoma. Machine learning predicts the spread of infectious diseases, for policymakers to plan for and prevent epidemics. Natural language processing in chatbots delivers real-time responses to sexual and reproductive health queries in HID/AIDS-affected communities. And in low-income countries where mortality rates from car accidents are the highest, the deep neural networks in self-driving cars make roads safer.  </p>
<p>The WHO estimates that achieving the health-related targets under the Sustainable Development Goals – from ending tuberculosis to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services by 2030 – will cost up to US$134-371 billion a year over current health spending. That’s billions of dollars we don’t have. What we do have is a wealth of data that can power promising, innovative solutions to bolster and accelerate existing global health programmes. Investing in AI today means high returns for people’s health and well-being tomorrow. </p>
