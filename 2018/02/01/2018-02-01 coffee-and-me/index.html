<p>$876.80. That’s how much I spent on Starbucks last year. That’s $2.40 per day, and doesn’t even take into account the purchases I made on other coffee brands. I’m usually really smart about <a href="http://bettychang.me/2017/12/20/2017-12-20%20financial-literacy/">saving</a> but when it comes to coffee, it’s a spending habit that I can’t seem to kick to the curb. And in light of this long overdue realization, I’d like to tell you about how it all started – my relationship with coffee. </p>
<h1 id="Act-1-Cafe-culture-on-campus"><a href="#Act-1-Cafe-culture-on-campus" class="headerlink" title="Act 1: Café culture on campus"></a>Act 1: Café culture on campus</h1><p>I had my first sip of coffee in freshmen year of college. We didn’t hit it off immediately. Coffee was bitter and sharp, and for $2.75 a cup, it seemed like a frivolous expense. But there was one aspect that I adored about the drink, and it was where one would buy it – at cafés.   </p>
<p>My college had nine cafés on campus, and 18 within a 100 m radius. Cafés had it all. Chill music. Homey décor. Pleasant service. Buttery croissants. And bustling with students. They’re a place to study outside of the monotonous confines of the library or classroom or dorm. But they’re also the perfect social hub for freshmen like me to meet up with new and old friends alike. </p>
<p><em>“Hey, let’s grab coffee before class?”</em><br><em>“You want to study at Second Cup tonight?”</em></p>
<p>Coffee was the medium that brought us together to break the ice, share ideas and stories, and gossip. Coffee culture on campus helped me get over the freshmen jitters and settle into college seamlessly.</p>
<h1 id="Act-2-Caffeine-my-love"><a href="#Act-2-Caffeine-my-love" class="headerlink" title="Act 2: Caffeine, my love"></a>Act 2: Caffeine, my love</h1><p>It was sophomore year during exam season when coffee and I got to know each other intimately, and I discovered the caffeine kick. </p>
<p>There’s a pressure for perfection at my college, fostered by hypercompetitive students and a rigorous education system - the admission cut off for my program last year was a 92%. To balance the increasing load of schoolwork, my extracurriculars, internships, and some semblance of a social life, I couldn’t do it alone. I relied on caffeine, the magical ingredient in coffee that decreases fatigue and provides a temporary boost of energy. A cup of coffee from Starbucks has a whopping 310 mg of caffeine per Grande, the most of any coffee chain in Canada. A cup would power me through the day, and once in a while, two would get me through the night. </p>
<p>And as an added bonus, studies have found that coffee consumption has been correlated with lower stress levels, and reduced risk of diabetes type II, melanoma, breast cancer. </p>
<h1 id="Act-3-Brewing-dependency"><a href="#Act-3-Brewing-dependency" class="headerlink" title="Act 3: Brewing dependency"></a>Act 3: Brewing dependency</h1><p>By the time junior year hit, coffee and I were going steady. </p>
<p>As a film buff, I noticed that leading ladies in Hollywood classics always had a cup in hand too.<br>In the opening scene of Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Holly Golightly steps out of a cab on 5th Avenue.<br><img src="/img/2018-02-01 breakfast-at-tiffanys.gif" alt="breakfast at tiffany&#39;s"></p>
<p>Surrounded by racks-on-racks of couture in Devil Wears Prada, Miranda Priestly demands:<br><img src="/img/2018-02-01 miranda-priestly.gif" alt="devil wears prada"></p>
<p>Madeline, Celeste, and Jane converge onto a Monterey café to have deep, thought-provoking conversations in Big Little Lies.<br><img src="/img/2018-02-01 big-little-lies.gif" alt="big little lies"></p>
<p>These chic, powerful and in control women made coffee look like the must-have accessory of the season. </p>
<p>And somehow, walking up the campus steps with one in hand made me feel that way too. Coffee was no longer a medium to broker social relationships, or a magical formula that helped me rally through all-nighters. It was a physical symbol of my maturity and confidence. I was obsessively dependent on coffee. </p>
<h1 id="Act-4-On-the-lookout-for-a-“fair-trade”"><a href="#Act-4-On-the-lookout-for-a-“fair-trade”" class="headerlink" title="Act 4: On the lookout for a “fair trade”"></a>Act 4: On the lookout for a “fair trade”</h1><p>But it’s not just me who is hooked. Coffee is a country wide-obsession. Data collected by the Canadian Coffee Association found that ½ of Canadians over 18 years of age drink a cup a day; and on average, coffee drinkers consume 3.2 cups per day and $1,092 a year on coffee. Coffee is a $6.2 billion market. </p>
<p>(Does it make me feel a little better that I spend less on average than the typical coffee drinker? You bet.)</p>
<p>My very serious relationship with coffee has lasted a good five and a half years, but it’s finally time to admit that it is just not working out. I’m ready to let go and move on, for the sake of my wallet. </p>
<p>So please do let me know if you have any <a href="mailto:betty.chang@mail.mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="external">recommendations</a> of less financially draining drinking habits. Currently trialing Chinese herbal tea bags, and my recently acquired $25 Amazon coffee press. </p>
