<p>Boiled down to its essence, what fuels me is people. That’s what has motivated me to bring together bright, ambitious entrepreneurs, investors, and advisors as part of startup communities since college when I led partnerships for the <a href="https://mchacks.ca/" target="_blank" rel="external">largest hackathon in Canada</a> and helped source deals as a strategy intern for <a href="https://realventures.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Real Ventures</a>, a seed-stage VC firm based in Montréal, an AI hub. </p>
<p>Since moving to New York two years ago, it’s been no different. I’ve attended hackathons, data and design events, and am part of Dreamers // Doers, a female-focused network of entrepreneurs, advisors and investors. I’m energized by the founders I’ve met who’ve turned problems into opportunities, and ideas into companies across this city’s <a href="http://www.govtech.com/civic/Whats-New-in-Civic-Tech-New-Report-Finds-7000-Startups-71-Billion-Ecosystem-in-NYC.html" target="_blank" rel="external">$71B ecosystem</a>. Three early-stage startups on my radar that are helmed by founders I admire that RSV should connect with (if you haven’t already!) are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>System, future of work</strong><br>Invest in your founders. Nowhere is this more apparent than with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bly-64b50964/" target="_blank" rel="external">Adam Bly</a> who led Data at Spotify after his data analytics startup was acquired by the streaming service. He left last year to start a new mission-driven <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-im-starting-new-ai-company-adam-bly/" target="_blank" rel="external">AI startup</a>. It’s still in stealth mode, but think Wikipedia for data with a developer tools business model á la Slack. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.publicgoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Public Goods</strong></a>, next gen commerce<br>It’s the direct-to-consumer revolution and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganhirsh/" target="_blank" rel="external">Morgan Hirsh</a>, a former executive for a supplier of F500 retail giants and the founder of Public Goods is taking full advantage of this. The startup sells healthy, premium products through a yearly subscription model and raised its first round of seed-funding via 10,260 backers on Kickstarter, who naturalized as Public Good’s early adopters. With an enviable brand identity and growing social media presence, Public Goods has done everything right in positioning itself as a formidable DTC startup. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.blueprintpower.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>Blueprint Power</strong></a>, wildcard<br>Blueprint Power, co-founded by ex-Googler and energy expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robyn-beavers-6507204/" target="_blank" rel="external">Robyn Beavers</a> unlocks new revenue for real-estate owners by transforming their buildings into power plants and connecting them to new energy markets and customers. Blueprint’s model is an easy one to get behind by centring itself on both social impact and profitability in the $276B energy sector.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lt-span-style-”color-FB1637-1"><a href="#lt-span-style-”color-FB1637-1" class="headerlink" title="&lt;span style=”color: #FB1637"></a>&lt;span style=”color: #FB1637</h2><p>“&gt;The Creative</p>
<p>Paintings, poetry, websites, software features. No matter the medium, I aim to create experiences that people need, want, and love. </p>
<p>RSV’s portfolio of digital disruptors deserve a platform fit for the digitally native, that centralizes stakeholders and resources while building out new relationships and networks. Beyond the obvious e.g. robust talent networks, external and internal events, social media presence, I’m excited by two ideas to grow RSV’s network. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Playbook, hard-won advice for founders.</strong><br>The best way to learn is from those who have gone down the path before. Every month, the Playbook, a digital blog series and newsletter features a founder or partner sharing unfiltered lessons and learnings on building their companies. The Playbook acts both as knowledge sharing and PR for RSV and its network. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>diveRSV, championing the Alley’s diversity.</strong><br>Fact: Only <a href="https://observer.com/2016/01/nyc-female-founders/" target="_blank" rel="external">21%</a> of VC-backed companies have female founders.  Startups and VCs are missing out on incredible talent because they’re not looking in the right places, while underserved talent struggle against systematic biases to be noticed. diveRSV is a vertical initiative across RSV’s platform to champion diversity and inclusion in the NYC ecosystem by: curating a talent network reflective of the New York’s diversity, showcasing underdog stories of our founders through multimedia, and holding office hours and events specifically for underrepresented groups like women and people of color. Not many VC firms have committed to diversity initiatives even though it’s smart business, good brand positioning, and the right thing to do. RSV has the opportunity to pave the way. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: RSV needs an active Instagram account! Examining the future of media marketing, founders especially in the consumer space have moved from Twitter to Instagram in utilizing the platform’s commercial tools to connect authentically and get feedback directly from their consumers, investors, and founders. RSV should be prioritizing its Instagram presence too. </p>
<h2 id="lt-span-style-”color-FB1637-2"><a href="#lt-span-style-”color-FB1637-2" class="headerlink" title="&lt;span style=”color: #FB1637"></a>&lt;span style=”color: #FB1637</h2><p>“&gt;The Resolute</p>
<p>My resumé isn’t linear. I’ve always been intrinsically curious, but it’s through determination and hard work that I’ve turned my curiosity into passion and impact. </p>
<p>I started college as a Biochemistry major, dabbling with the idea of becoming a medical researcher. In my first year at the hospital I was working at, I saw how technology was augmenting the healthcare sector and set about on a mission to learn the technical side. I taught myself programming basics to land a job at Intel as a Product Manager in my sophomore year designing a new first-time user feature for their core consumer security software. I’m still coding and learning everyday. </p>
<p>As a new graduate, I wanted to be in the thick of solving high-impact, global challenges and was hired as the youngest consultant hired at the World Health Organization. I was promoted to Special Assistant of Innovation strategizing partnerships and investments with tech startups in emerging markets. </p>
<p>I’ve turned a passion for wordsmithing into a small business authoring and ghost-writing op-eds and articles for the Globe &amp; Mail, HuffPost, and New York Times’ The Edit.</p>
<p>I’ve brought together more than 1,300 students and technologists through the events I’ve curated across tech ecosystems in Geneva, Montréal, New York, and Toronto. </p>
<p>I hope to be able to continue doing so at Red Sea Ventures. </p>
