                                    <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                                        <p>In my junior year of high school, I decided to run for Vice-President of my Student Council. I had the credentials: Reputation and good grades with teachers;and years of service as President of the Announcements team, member of the Waterpolo and Swim Team, and a volunteer at Best Buddies. I campaigned hard: I listened to the biggest challenges and complaints of students in hallways, on social media, and on busses; enlisted trusty friends to spread the word; and had a talented running mate for President. I had a tangible, ambitious platform: more funding for school events and extracurriculars; new diversity programs targeted to freshmen &amp; women; and extended exam periods. And during Speech Day - the pivotal make-or-break moment of the campaign - I summarized all of this in an uplifting speech, while my opponent rapped and danced. </p>
<p>I lost. The days after, I was devastated. I knew that I was the most qualified candidate, I had put so much effort, heart and thought into my campaign and vice-presidency, not to mention the embarrassment of standing in front of all my friends, peers, and losing to my opponent who rapped…  </p>
<p>It was the first momentous time I had decided to throw my hat into the ring and dedicate my time, heart, and thought into a goal and lost. And although it was difficult and bitter to swallow defeat, it surely won’t be the last time I take a chance and lose. 2017 was a year of taking chances, leading to both incredible successes and painful losses. I started writing and publishing in major publications and news agencies, I traveled to Africa for the first time to work on a government project, and trained to become an Activist Council member for Planned Parenthood NYC. And throughout it all, I lost. Alot. I was passed over for a potential new job that I completed four rounds of interviews for, I applied to one of the biggest intergovernmental conferences in the world and was rejected, and I rallied and protested against a Republican Tax Rewrite that ultimately was passed. </p>
<p>Through it all, here’s what I learned:</p>
<p><strong>1. Be ambitious</strong></p>
<p>Ambition is sometimes taken as a word with negative connotations of greed, reductiveness and selfishness. But for me, ambition is about the impact I can make on the world, breaking glass ceilings that stand in the way, and dreaming big. </p>
<p><strong>2. Learn from your losses</strong><br>I learn more from losing moreso than winning anyways. Every loss can be attributed to factors within and beyond your control, so dissect what you did have control of, what you can do better next time, and move on - apply that to the future endeavours you take on. </p>
<p><strong>3. Just do it</strong></p>
<p>Nike said it best. Don’t just talk the talk, but turn those words, ambition, and big dreams into action with tangible goals and results. </p>
<p>And as we move into a New Year, take this ambition, learnings, and action to bring the change you want to see in the world to life. Best wishes, and looking forward to seeing what 2018 brings for you and me!</p>
<p>On a side tangent: One of my New Year “goals” was to read a book a week, at the least. Coincidentally, the first book I just finished was <em>What Happened</em> by a lady I admire greatly for breaking glass ceilings for women around the world over the past few decades and 2016-2017 especially, Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton. Her recountings of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections also happened to trigger the memory of my bittersweet (High School Student Council) Vice-Presidential defeat… </p>
